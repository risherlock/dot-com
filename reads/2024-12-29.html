<h3 class="title">
  Harry potter and the chamber of secrets<br>
  by JK Rowling
</h3>

<p>
  I re-read it more than a decade later with an intention of introducing my wife to Harry Potter adventures, and this is also undoubtedly the first book I read to someone. We started it early February and completed it on 24th March 2024. I realized lots of things which I had forgotten/missed in the first reading. I seem to be able to see more plot holes and silly occurrences, but in general the charm is still the same and I had fun reading dramatically to my wife to add suspense.
