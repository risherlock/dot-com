<p>
  The best thing about writing to let go your thoughts is you can come back to it as you scroll down your timeline<br>
  And the worst thing about writing to let your thoughts is you can come back to it as you scroll down your timeline<br>
  And somewhere in silence the echo of voices sinks, delayed by ages, renewed by new wounds<br>
  And sometimes in decades, your numbness fades away, and the dust that scattered above your vision vapours away<br>
  And the moments on which those words hit the page, reverbs as sadness, thin and spooky as ghost<br>
  Disgusted by your being, you cry to wash your clowns, desperate to throw all the times you let yourself down.
