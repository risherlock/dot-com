  Easy suffocation

<p>
  I lay hollow, untamed in this cloud, too cozy for me to move<br>
  The walls too close to feel the wind that hovers screaming the stretches of glory behind this caving<br>
  I lower my roof every time I give up, and every time I comfort my tears with pointing finger to what lays beyond that wall<br>
  My cloud thickens, the roof drops and the walls tighten and a word disappears from what elucidates my being<br>
  <br>
  This vicious loop i live in an endless scroll with tiring eyes<br>
  My mind races with pulsating dopamine hits, and ear buzzes with repeating sounds<br>
  AM I ALIVE? AM I SINKING? IS THE DOOR OPEN? ARE THE WINDOWS BLINKING?<br>
  My soulless journey, a flowing river, I drift as wood through the turns and flicker and get caught in edge, in rocks, in leaves, but go unnoticed, unclaimed, uncared<br>
  Coz my world, I have, is a windowless sphere<br>
  And it shrinks every time I go with fear, and eliminate the subjects and curate the ease<br>
  My being is two lettered <i>m</i> and <i>e</i><br>
  <br>
  And sometimes when forbidden darkness dawns, I repeat the algorithm, I repeat I drown<br>
  In my world of lost cause, in this sinking ship<br>
  Blocking the airways, crushing all things<br>
  It seems I am too blind to world beyond ease.<br>
