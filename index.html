<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  I am Rishav (ऋषभ). Welcome to my website where I attempt to document my hobbies, tinkerings, and researches. As an amateur, I enjoy reading and thinking about physics and mathematics. As a researcher, I am interested in both theoretical and applied problems of control and estimation theory. I am genuinely astounded by, as Eugene Wigner put it, <i>The unreasonable eﬀectiveness of mathematics</i> as the language of nature. This is the part of reason I enjoy the software implementations of theoretical and mathematical ideas. I have a passion for embedded systems and enjoy the processes involved; breadboard prototyping, PCB design, and writing embedded firmware.
</p>

<p>
  I must emphasize that, in this website, I write as a student and do not pretend to be a professional in the field. I have my own growing list of <a href="extras/plans.html">ideas and problems</a> that I like to study and think about in my own time. Writing about them gives me a reason to study in detail and prevents me from fooling myself with a false pretense of understanding the topic. Indeed, it is when writing for a third person that one realizes how much one does not know. Practically every blog post is first read and edited by my wife, Sriza, before I consider it ready for publication. She does an excellent job of finding faults in my line of reasoning and judging whether the content is suitable for readers.

<p>
  It took some time for me to realize that modern tools and methods of web design are too complex for me to understand and maintain, so I decided to go bare minimum which seems to serve my purpose (hopefully it does to the reader too). I would appreciate if you write to me if what I write matches your own line of research; either as a feedback or to point errors.
