<h2>a tinkerer's log</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to my website! I'm Rishav (ऋषभ), and this is where I document my tinkerings and research. I am interested in both theoretical and applied problems of control and estimation theory. I am genuinely astounded by what Eugene Wigner described as <i>the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics</i> as the language of nature. I also enjoy embedded systems, from breadboard prototyping and PCB design to writing embedded firmware.
</p>

<p>
  I must emphasize that, on this website, I write as a learner and do not pretend to be a professional in the field. I maintain a growing list of <a href="extras/plans.html">ideas and problems</a> that I like to study and ponder in my own time. Writing about them gives me a reason to study topics in detail and prevents me from having a false sense of understanding. Virutally every blog post is first read and edited by my wife, Sriza, before I consider it ready for publication. She does an excellent job of spotting flaws in my reasoning.
