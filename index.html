<h2>a tinkerer's log</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to my website! I'm Rishav (ऋषभ), and here I document my tinkerings and research. As a researcher, I am interested in theoretical and applied problems of control systems and estimation theory. I am genuinely astounded by what Eugene Wigner described as <i>the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics</i> as the language of nature <a href="#wigner1960">[1]</a>. I also enjoy embedded systems, from breadboard prototyping and PCB design to writing embedded firmware.
</p>

<p>
  I must emphasize that I write as a learner and do not pretend to be a professional in the field. I keep a running list of <a href="extras/plans.html">ideas and problems</a> that I like to study and ponder in my own time. Writing about them gives me a good reason to dive deeper. it also helps me avoid the trap of thinking I understand something when I really don't. Almost every post is first read and <i>approved</i> by my wife, Sriza, before I publish it. She has a sharp eye for catching flaws in my reasoning, which I truly admire and respect.
</p>

<p>
  The preface of <a href="#hayes2008">[2]</a> made me realize I that share Hayes' <q>itchy pencil</q> tendency&mdash;so posts here may get updated or edited whenever the mood strikes. After all, understanding of a topic grows with time, and past writing sometimes needs a touch-up.
</p>

  Please feel free to <a href="mailto:risherlock221b@gmail.com">write to me</a>, especially if what I share aligns with your interests&mdash;whether as feedback or to point out any errors.
